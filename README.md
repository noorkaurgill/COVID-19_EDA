# COVID-19_EDA

This study was undertaken in order to examine the effects of public policy measures and
the availability of resources such as healthcare workers and hospitals on virus spread and
mortality rate amidst the current COVID-19 pandemic, within the United States. Using the
publicly available covid19 dataset, the focus question for this exploratory data analysis is
whether or not we can use prior information of precautionary measures and policies enacted in
response to COVID-19 in various counties to accurately predict the spread of the virus, defined
as the number of confirmed cases. We also examine the optimum availability of hospital
equipment or number of frontline hospital workers in the patient's county in order to minimize
the death rate. Both of these topics are trending in political media and news outlets. In order to
investigate these inquiries, an extensive 5-step data cleaning was performed, numerous distinct
and descriptive visualizations were developed and analyzed such as density mapping and by
PCA, in addition to creating, fitting, and utilizing a logistic regression model and gradient
descent algorithm. Through logistic regression, data on social distancing and precautionary
measures was used to predict the spread of the virus within a given county. While gradient
descent for optimizing the number of full-time hospital workers to minimize the mortality rate
did not converge to the MSE, associations between features such as population served by
healthcare practitioners within a HPSA and the number of hospitals or ICU beds were exhibited.
This analysis, based on the data science life cycle, examines not only the role of measures such
as shelter-in-place and restrictions on gatherings to “flatten the curve,” but also reveals
discrepancies in the allocation of resources and healthcare jobs across United States counties,
which emphasizes the importance of public policy during a pandemic.
